A chain of basic stock screening scripts (loosely) tied together with pysimplegui.

Scrapes daily NSE (volume/gainers/losers) stocks and generates picks based on (DEMA/Momentum/Price action) signals.

Generates weights for optimal portfolios via random weights and calculates/plots the efficient frontier for a mix of stocks.

Price alerts for watchlist stocks.

# Installation

Create a new python virtual environment and install requirements.txt :

```
python -m venv <name>

cd <name>

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note - python-Levenshtein might be a hassle to install for windows users; a simpler way would be to download the wheel from http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#python-levenshtein

... and install via 


`
pip install <path_to_whl>
`

Alternately, download the win 64 pyinstaller dist from the releases section.

# Functions

1. Picks - day (interval 1d, period ytd) / iday (interval 1d, period ytd) : Generates daily stock pick shortlists.
2. Folio - gets the optimal weights of a mix of tickers (via text list/csv file upload)
3. BHS - buy/hodl/sell signals based on dema/momentum/price action. 
4. Alerts - alerts for stocks added to watchlist (5 min alerts during market hours, 15 during the rest)
5. Del - remove stocks from watchlist alerts
